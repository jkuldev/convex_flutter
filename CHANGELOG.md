## 3.0.0

### Major New Features

- **🌐 Web Platform Support**: Full web platform support with pure Dart implementation
  - Uses native browser WebSocket API (no FFI required)
  - 100% API compatibility with native platforms
  - Automatic platform selection via conditional imports
  - No Rust toolchain required for web builds
  - All features work identically on web: queries, mutations, actions, subscriptions, auth

### Web Implementation Details

- Implemented Convex WebSocket wire protocol in pure Dart:
  - RFC 4122 compliant UUID v4 generation for session IDs
  - Proper protocol message formatting (Connect, ModifyQuerySet, Mutation, Action, Transition, Ping/Pong)
  - Query set version tracking with baseVersion/newVersion

  - Added `com.apple.security.network.client` to both DebugProfile.entitlements and Release.entitlements
  - macOS apps can now establish WebSocket connections to Convex backend

- **Fixed Android missing INTERNET permission**:
  - Added `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />` to AndroidManifest.xml
  - Android apps now have proper network access

- **Fixed Rust rustls CryptoProvider error**:
  - Removed `default-features = false` from convex dependency in Cargo.toml
  - rustls 0.23+ now has proper CryptoProvider configuration

### Improvements

### Migration Guide

No migration needed - existing code works without changes on all platforms including web.

To build for web:
```bash
flutter build web
```

No Rust toolchain required for web builds!

## 1.2.0

## 2.0.0

- Replaced ArcSubscriptionHandle with SubscriptionHandle

## 2.1.0

### New Features

- **Singleton Pattern**: New `ConvexClient.initialize(ConvexConfig)` method with `ConvexClient.instance` access
- **Operation Timeouts**: Configurable timeout for all queries, mutations, and actions (default: 30 seconds)
- **Connection Management**: Manual connection checking with `checkConnection()` and `reconnect()` methods
- **Lifecycle Monitoring**: Stream of app lifecycle events (resumed, paused, inactive, detached)
- **Configuration Class**: New `ConvexConfig` class for cleaner initialization

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed critical Rust subscription panic when WebSocket connection closes unexpectedly
- Subscription streams now exit gracefully instead of crashing the app

### Improvements

- Better error handling for connection issues with `ConnectionStatus` enum
- App lifecycle integration with `AppLifecycleObserver`
- Comprehensive documentation updates with new usage examples
- Example app updated to demonstrate new features

### API Changes

- **Deprecated**: `ConvexClient.init()` is now deprecated, use `ConvexClient.initialize(ConvexConfig)` instead
- **New**: `ConvexClient.instance` - Access singleton anywhere
- **New**: `ConvexClient.initialize(ConvexConfig)` - Initialize with configuration
- **New**: `checkConnection()` - Manual connection status check
- **New**: `reconnect()` - Manual reconnection attempt
- **New**: `lifecycleEvents` stream - Monitor app lifecycle
- **Enhanced**: All queries, mutations, and actions now respect `operationTimeout`

### Breaking Changes

None - backward compatibility maintained through deprecated methods

## 2.2.0

### New Features

- **Real-Time WebSocket Connection State**: Monitor WebSocket connection status via reactive streams
  - `connectionState` stream - Real-time connection state updates (Connected/Connecting)
  - `currentConnectionState` getter - Synchronous access to current state
  - `isConnected` getter - Quick boolean check for connection status
  - Automatic state transitions when WebSocket connects/disconnects
  - No polling required - pure event-driven updates

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed critical race condition in WebSocket connection initialization**
  - Issue: State change callback was registered after WebSocket connection began, causing state transitions to be lost
  - Root cause: Async task spawning in `connected_client()` created unpredictable timing delays
  - Solution: Removed task spawning and build ConvexClient directly in async context
  - Result: Callback is now guaranteed to be registered before `builder.build()` is called

- **Fixed WebSocket connection state stuck on "connecting"**
  - Issue: Example app showed "connecting" forever without transitioning to "connected"
  - Root cause: No operations were triggered on app startup, so `connected_client()` was never called
  - Solution: Added auto-connection trigger in example app's HomeScreen initialization
  - Result: Connection establishes automatically on startup with proper state transitions

### Improvements

- Enhanced example app with comprehensive WebSocket connection state demonstrations:
  - Connection status indicator in app bar with real-time visual feedback
  - Dedicated Connection screen showing current state and history
  - Automatic connection on app startup
  - All 5 screens demonstrating different SDK capabilities
  - Added HEALTH_CHECK.md guide for setting up health check queries

- Documentation improvements:
  - Comprehensive WebSocket connection state usage examples
  - Recommended health check query pattern using `health:ping`
  - TypeScript example for creating health check query in Convex backend
  - Updated all examples to use dedicated health check instead of `messages:list`
  - Deprecated `checkConnection()` in favor of real-time `connectionState` stream

- Code quality:
  - Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting connection issues
  - Better error handling in auto-connection flow
  - Clearer comments explaining lazy initialization

### API Changes

- **New**: `connectionState` stream - Real-time WebSocket connection state updates (`Stream<WebSocketConnectionState>`)
- **New**: `currentConnectionState` getter - Synchronous access to current connection state
- **New**: `isConnected` getter - Boolean check for WebSocket connection status
- **Deprecated**: `checkConnection()` - Use `connectionState` stream for real-time monitoring instead

### Breaking Changes

None - all changes are additive and maintain backward compatibility
